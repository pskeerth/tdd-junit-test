In men's public toilets with urinals, there is this unwritten rule that you leave at least one urinal free between you and 
the next person peeing. For example, if there are 3 urinals and one person is already peeing in the left one, you will 
choose the urinal on the right and not the one in the middle. That means that a maximum of 3 people can pee at the 
same time on public toilets with 5 urinals when following this rule (Only 2 if the first-person pees into urinal 2 or 4). 

This code is written to solve this problem
Unit tests are written for the three cases to be tested

Error messages added to output file instead of -1
Invalid string - if the string contains anything other that 1s and 0s
String too long -  if the string length is more than 20 chars

please look at develop and staging branch, only two main commits to master
